//Any type should be avoided.
//Any type - infered type if nothing defined.
//More liek pure javascript.
let coupon;

//Even here type is till any
coupon = 25;

//Aaand it goes...
coupon = "25";

coupon = true;

//But if you add type at the beginning - no kebab;

//Use cases - transition from pure javascript;
//Or when we want to opt out of typescript
//Typescript - makes you better;
